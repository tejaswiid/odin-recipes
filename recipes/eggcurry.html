    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The Egg curry originated in the humble Awadhi kitchen. According to
      20th-century food historian Alan Davidson, it was invented experimentally
      by a cook who took a hard-boiled egg, enclosed it in the mutton mince, and
      deep fried it

        <li>
          In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add the onions
          and cook, stirring occasionally, until evenly caramelized and light
          brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and fry,
          stirring occasionally, another 4 minutes. Add the cinnamon and
          cardamom. When the spices start to toast, after about 2 minutes, stir
          in the coriander, turmeric and peppercorns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the tomatoes, salt and 1 cup water. Cook, stirring occasionally,
          until the mixture thickens and the fat rises to the top, about 15
          minutes. Stir in the garam masala and lower the heat. If the sauce
          isn’t runny, stir in ½ cup water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add all but 2 of the eggs and stir gently. Halve the remaining eggs
          lengthwise and arrange on top, yolk-side up. Heat until the eggs are
          warmed through, then top with cilantro.
