      <h3>How to make</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat a thick bottomed pan or kadai on low flame. Add 1 cup urad dal
          (black gram).
        </li>
        <li>Keep the heat on low or sim and begin to roast the urad dal.</li>
        <li>Stir often, while roasting.</li>
        <li>
          Keep on roasting and stirring for even browning and cooking. Roasting
          urad dal well is very important. Partially roasted or half-roasted
          urad dal can give stomach aches.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is the dal after 12 minutes of roasting. The dal needs to be
          golden and become aromatic. Your kitchen will have the aroma of
          roasted urad dal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here is how the urad dal looks after roasting for one more minute.
          Keep on stirring without a break once the dal begins to get light
          golden.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, let the dal cool in the pan itself or you can remove the dal in a
          plate and let it cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the lentils have become warm or cooled, add them in a grinder
          jar. Also, add cardamom seeds from 3 to 4 green cardamom pods.
        </li>
        <li>Now, take the urad dal flour in a fine sieve.</li>
        <li>
          Here is the same mixture after cooling down. It has become dense and
          now you can easily shape the mixture into laddu.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare more laddu with the remaining mixture.</li>
        <li>
          You can offer Sunnundalu or Urad Dal Laddu to the deities as naivedyam
          or serve to your family. Store the remaining laddu in an air-tight box
          or jar and refrigerate.
        </li>
